** The goal of this task is to swap each of the stringâ€™s characters, two by two.
In other words, you will swap the first letter with the last one, the second with the second-to-last and so on.
The function should return a pointer to the first character of the reversed string:
char *my_evil_str(char *str);
*/
char *my_evil_str(char *str)
{
    int i = 0;
    char temp;  
    int n = my_strlen(str)-1;   

    while ( i < n){
         temp = str[i];  
         str[i] = str[n];
         str[n] = temp;
         i++;
         n--;
    }
    return (str);
}
